I'm Ryosuke Nagumo, Machine Learning Engineer. My interests are Bayesian statistics, time series, and data science.

## Interests

* **Bayesian statistics**

  * Bayesian machine learninng [github](https://github.com/rnagumo/bayes_ml)

  * Deep generative model (ex. VAE) [github](https://github.com/rnagumo/dgmvae)

* **Time-series analysis**

  * Bayesian structured time series models [github](https://github.com/rnagumo/tfp_sample)

  * Deep state-space models (ex. Variational RNN, Deep markov model) [github](https://github.com/rnagumo/dgmseq)

* **Bayesian non-parametrics**

  * Gaussian process [github](https://github.com/rnagumo/GaussianProcess)

  * Neural process

* **Data science**

  * Sustainable data science by readability and reproducibility [document](https://github.com/rnagumo/datasci_template/blob/master/readability_reproducibility.md)
