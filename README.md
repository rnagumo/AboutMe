# Work

## 04/2015 - 03/2017 Quantum optics, Near-field optics, and Spin mechanics (M. degree)

I got Master degree in the field of Quantum optics, Near-field optics, and Spin mechanics.


## 04/2017 - 03/2018 Acoustic and linguisti analysis for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease.

I joined the R&D team which aims to develop the machine learning systems to predict Alzheimer's disease from elderly person's voice. I'm in charge of machine learning engineering of vocal signal processing and natural language processings. Acoustic signal processing includes the vocal utterance prediction, calculation of MFCC, and feature engineering. In the field of natural language processing, I'm engaged in feature engineering including Bag-of-Words of n-gram, Tf-idf, perplexity, word2vec, and Attention mechanism.

## 04/2018 - now Time-series analysis in the industrial field.

I'm in the R&D team which provides the time-series analysis to the industrial field. I created the time-series prediction model with LightGBM and Python package running in the server. 


# Interests

The followings are my interests.

## Bayesian Statistics

It is the attraction of Bayesian statistics that can represent the uncertainty in data.

## Stochastic process, Bayesian non-parametrics

I'm especially interested in Gaussian process.

## Time-series analysis

For example, Bayesian structural time series models.

## Anomaly detection

## Causal inference, Counterfactual ML, Bandit problem

## Statistical learning theory
