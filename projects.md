* [**vaelib**](https://github.com/rnagumo/vaelib)

  VAE library in PyTorch. VAE is latent variable models with deep learning which can model complex distributions.

* [**seqlib**](https://github.com/rnagumo/seqlib)

  2D sequential modeling based on VAE. VAEs can be used as a sequential model. A naive implementation is a state-space model with deep learnings, which is assumed deep Kalman filter. Modern recurrent structures such as LSTM can also be used.

* [**neuralprocess**](https://github.com/rnagumo/neuralprocess)

  Neural Processes in PyTorch. Neural Processes are a neural version of Gaussian processes that can express the flexible functions with context data.

* [**Readability and reproducibility**](https://github.com/rnagumo/datasci_template/blob/master/readability_reproducibility.md)

  Documents for practical data science which ensures readability and reproducibility.

* [**dgmvae**](https://github.com/rnagumo/dgmvae)

  Deep Generative Model: Variational Auto-Encoder. This project aims to reproduce disentanglement_lib, that quantitatively evaluates disentanglement power of various VAE models.

* [**dgmseq**](https://github.com/rnagumo/dgmseq)

  Deep Generative Models for sequential data. This project is sample codes for polyphonic sequential data which is used for baseline for deep sequential models such as Variational RNN.
