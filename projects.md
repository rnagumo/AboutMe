* [**dgmvae**](https://github.com/rnagumo/dgmvae)

  Deep Generative Model: Variational Auto-Encoder. This project aims to reproduce disentanglement_lib, that quantitatively evaluates disentanglement power of various VAE models.

* [**dgmseq**](https://github.com/rnagumo/dgmseq)

  Deep Generative Models for sequential data. This project is sample codes for polyphonic sequential data which is used for baseline for deep sequential models such as Variational RNN.

* [**Readability and reproducibility**](https://github.com/rnagumo/datasci_template/blob/master/readability_reproducibility.md)

  Documents for practical data science which ensures readability reproducibility.
